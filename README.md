# ISS Tracker

**ISS Tracker** is a Python application that allows users to track the International Space Station (ISS) in real-time. The app retrieves the current location of the ISS using a public API and notifies users when the ISS is overhead, especially during nighttime, providing a great opportunity for viewing.
